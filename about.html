        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>The system captures video input of a user signing in ASL through the camera connected to a Raspberry Pi. This input is then processed using a machine learning model trained to recognize ASL signs. The interpreted signs are displayed as text on the user's screen, helping them correct and improve their skills in real-time.</p>
        <h2>Our Goals</h2>
        <p>We aim to make learning ASL more accessible and interactive. By providing immediate feedback, we help learners quickly adjust their signs, speeding up the learning process and increasing the accuracy of their language use.</p>
        <h2>Team</h2>
        <p>This project is developed by a dedicated team of developers passionate about making educational tools more effective and engaging.</p>
